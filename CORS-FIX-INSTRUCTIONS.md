# 🚨 URGENT: Fix CORS Issue - Redeploy Google Apps Script

## Problem Identified
Your contact form is failing due to a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy error. The Google Apps Script is not allowing requests from your website domain.

## ✅ Solution Applied
I've updated your `Code.gs` file with proper CORS handling:

1. **Added `doOptions()` function** - Handles CORS preflight requests
2. **Added `doGet()` function** - Handles GET requests and testing
3. **Added CORS headers** to all responses (success and error)
4. **Updated response format** to include proper headers

## 🔧 Required Actions

### Step 1: Update Your Google Apps Script
1. Go to your Google Apps Script project: https://script.google.com/
2. Replace the content of `Code.gs` with the updated version from your local file
3. Or copy the updated code from `google-sheets-setup/Code.gs`

### Step 2: Redeploy the Script
**This is crucial - you MUST redeploy for changes to take effect:**

1. In Google Apps Script, click **"Deploy"** → **"Manage deployments"**
2. Click the **edit icon (pencil)** next to your current deployment
3. Change the version to **"New version"**
4. Make sure settings are:
   - **Execute as:** Me (your email)
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. **Copy the new Web app URL** (it might be the same or different)

### Step 3: Update Your Website (if URL changed)
If you got a new Web app URL, update it in your `index.html`:
```javascript
const scriptURL = 'YOUR_NEW_URL_HERE';
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Open your website
2. Try submitting the contact form
3. Check the browser console - you should see:
   - "Response received: {status: 200, statusText: 'OK', ok: true}"
   - "Contact form submitted successfully"

## 🧪 Quick Test

You can test if your Google Apps Script is working by:
1. Opening the script URL directly in a browser
2. You should see: `{"status":"ok","message":"SFC Solution Contact Form API is running","timestamp":"..."}`

## 📋 Updated Code Summary

Your Google Apps Script now includes:
- ✅ **doOptions()** - Handles CORS preflight requests
- ✅ **doGet()** - Handles GET requests and API testing
- ✅ **doPost()** - Handles form submissions with CORS headers
- ✅ **Proper error handling** with CORS headers
- ✅ **Email notifications** (optional)
- ✅ **Test function** for debugging

## 🔍 What Was Wrong Before

The original script was missing:
- CORS headers in responses
- doOptions() function for preflight requests
- Proper content-type headers

This caused browsers to block the requests due to same-origin policy.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **You MUST redeploy** - just saving the code isn't enough
2. **Choose "New version"** when redeploying
3. **Keep "Anyone" access** - this is required for your website to access it
4. **Test immediately** after redeploying

## 🎯 Expected Result

After redeploying, your contact form should:
- ✅ Submit successfully
- ✅ Show success message
- ✅ Close modal automatically
- ✅ Save data to Google Sheets
- ✅ Send email notification (if configured)

## 📞 If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check the browser console for new error messages
2. Test the script URL directly in a browser
3. Verify the deployment settings in Google Apps Script
4. Make sure you're using the latest Web app URL

The CORS issue should be completely resolved with these changes!
